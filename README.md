## Planning Story
  Make sure to break down the game in smaller portions into manageable assignments. Use bootstrap to help assist make and design the board and page. Initially, I forgot about using jquery but that turned out to be a very strong tool to use for interacting with the gameboard and displaying messages to the user. I'm using Javascript to build the logic to the game to decided the game's outcome. I want to use an array to store the moves made and reference that to the winning possiblities.

### User Story

- As a user I want to sign in/up/out,change my password
- As a user I want to play a new game after each game is done
- As a user I want to view my games history
- As a user I want to see who's turn it is
- As a user I want to know when a game is over and who won
- As a user I want to not able to change opponents move
- As a user I don’t want to be able to change my password when I’m logged out
- As a user I don’t want to be able to sign out when I’m not signed in nor sign out when I’m not signed in

### Technologies used

- jQuery
- HTML/CSS
- Bootstrap
- Javascript

### Unsolved Problems

- Still need to take the game to a make over stylist.

- Would like to eventually have an AI, designs for X and O, chat system using emojis if online play available.
